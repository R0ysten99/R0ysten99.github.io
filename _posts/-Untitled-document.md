Blog 2

I made lots of progress on my Github blog today. I started off the lesson doing a starter activity to get my brain working. The starter activity was quite hard and i got stuck so i had to ask for help. The starter was hard and i couldn't complete it in the lesson. The blog was the main part of the lesson as i fixed the problem i had had with my blog. This really helped my progress and when it was done i really advanced my work at a much quicker rate and it was very helpful to speeding up my blog as it was much quicker progress and i finished my blog and it was made much more effective.
