Blog 1

This blog is to show the progress i am making. I have successfully put in a lot of new and original code to simulate an actual conversation with a real person. The person who this is talking to will be the one this tries to convince that it's real. The code I worked on this lesson was making the original code more user friendly and use the previous info i had gotten from the person and making them feel like the user remembers the name and that is helpful for the trick to convincing the person that the computer is a real time human thinking and responding to the person
